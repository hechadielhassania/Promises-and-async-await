# Promises and async/await

## Introduction
This project demonstrates practical applications of asynchronous JavaScript techniques, including Promises and the async/await syntax. Asynchronous code is commonly used in web development for tasks that involve waiting for data or resources.

## Overview
The project includes a function called `getUserData(id)` that retrieves user information from multiple databases asynchronously. The function takes an `id` parameter and returns a Promise that resolves to an object containing specific data associated with the user.

## Implementation
- The function utilizes Promise chaining via `then()` statements to handle asynchronous operations.
- It ensures that database requests complete within 200ms by using Promise.all to handle requests concurrently.
- Error handling is implemented to handle invalid inputs and database errors.

## Testing
The function is tested with various id values, including valid numbers (1 through 10), invalid numbers, and invalid data types, to ensure robustness and correctness.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a practical demonstration of asynchronous JavaScript techniques, essential for modern web development. By implementing Promises and async/await syntax effectively, developers can create efficient and responsive applications.
